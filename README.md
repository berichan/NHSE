NHSE - USB
=====
<div>

[NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE) with an interface for [USB-Botbase](https://github.com/fishguy6564/USB-Botbase) so you can edit your inventory while locally visiting (ideally your own) island.

Requires LibUsbDotNet (use NuGet in vs2019)

Usage:

On your console:
Install [USB-Botbase](https://github.com/fishguy6564/USB-Botbase) to your console, this will not run at the same time as sys-botbase.
Follow the instructions on the USB-Botbase page to install the correct driver;
Make sure you select libusbK in Zadig (requires you to use the up/down arrows in the right field) and that a filter is created in libusb for your device. Restart your device once done.

On NHSE-USB:
Press CTRL+I as usual to open the Sysbot inventory window (do not load a save), press inject and use the USB section to read and write the inventory data.

Todo: literally everything else that sysbot does.

Reiterating from NHSE:
